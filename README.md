# Disneyland-Review

In the project, we will use three primary Disneyland reviews--Paris, California and Hong Kong-- to analyze the trip qualities and visitor’s experiences. 
From their reviews and ratings for each park, we will extract relevant information about visitor’s attitudes and feedback towards the events, time, programming and even food in Disneyland. 
With this information, we will get to know about visitors’ needs and expectations. 
Therefore, we could formulate suggestions and aims of future marketing or programming for Disneyland based on past comments. 
The predictions of possible improvements will ultimately help Disneyland provide better services and become more popular among trip seekers, thus raising the overall profits for the company.
